# PART A:
This code is a program written in Python that generates all connected sub-graphs of a given size, n. The program utilizes the networkx library for graph operations and itertools for combinations. The generated sub-graphs are then written to a textual file in a specific format.

Function Descriptions
create_all_possible_graphs(n)
This function creates all possible graphs of size n. It generates a list of all possible binary strings representing edges, and then converts them into graph representations using networkx's DiGraph class. The function returns a tuple containing the list of all graphs, the binary strings, and the total number of graphs generated.

filter_graphs(allGraphs, allPos, z, n)
This function applies filters to the generated graphs to remove isomorphic graphs, graphs with less than n connected nodes, and non-n connected graphs. It modifies the input lists to remove the filtered graphs and returns the updated lists and the new total number of graphs.

write_graphs_to_file(graphs, n)
This function writes the filtered graphs to a textual file in the specified format. It opens a file with a name based on the size of the sub-graphs and writes the count of sub-graphs followed by the graph representations.

run_partA(n)
This function is the main driver function for generating and writing the sub-graphs. It calls the create_all_possible_graphs function to generate all possible graphs, then filters them using the filter_graphs function. Finally, it writes the filtered graphs to a file using the write_graphs_to_file function.

check_time()
This function measures the time taken to execute run_partA(n) for different values of n. It determines the maximum value of n that can be completed within specific time intervals (1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 8 hours). The results are written to a file named "PartA_times.txt".

Task Execution
To execute the program, run the script and enter a positive integer n as input. The program will generate and write the sub-graphs of size n to a file. Additionally, it will measure the execution time for different values of n and write the results to the "PartA_times.txt" file.

For the given task:

a)
The program generates all connected sub-graphs of size n and writes them to a textual file in the specified format.
b)
The output of the program for n = 1 to 4 will be available in separate files named "sub-graphs with 1 nodes.txt", "sub-graphs with 2 nodes.txt", "sub-graphs with 3 nodes.txt", and "sub-graphs with 4 nodes.txt
c+d)The maximum value of 'n' for which the code can complete in an hour is found to be n=4. Additionally, if we allow the code to run for up to 2 hours, it can handle n=5. However, when trying to run the code for n=6, it didn't finish running even after eight hours. Therefore, the final conclusion is that for 2 hours-8 hours  the optimal value for 'n' is determined as 5.
